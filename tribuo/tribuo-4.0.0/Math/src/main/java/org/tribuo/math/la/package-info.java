/**
 * Provides a linear algebra system used for numerical operations in Tribuo.
 * <p>
 * There are Dense and Sparse vectors and Matrices, along with a DenseSparseMatrix which is
 * a dense array of sparse row vectors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It's a single threaded implementation in pure Java. We're looking at ways of improving the speed
 * using new technologies coming in future releases of Java.
